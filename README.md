# Qatar National Energy Model

## A. Vision Statement

The Qatar National Energy Model (QNEM) is an open-source, collaborative platform designed to simulate and analyze the long-term economic impacts of Qatar's energy production policies. Our vision is to provide a transparent, data-driven tool that enables policymakers, academics, and industry stakeholders to evaluate the effects of various gas production and pricing scenarios on Qatar's GDP, economic diversification efforts, and regional influence. By fostering academic collaboration across Education City, we aim to create a robust model that supports strategic decision-making in alignment with the Qatar National Vision 2030.

## B. Guiding Principles

- **Academic Integrity**: All contributions must adhere to the highest standards of academic rigor and ethical research.
- **Data Transparency**: Source data, assumptions, and methodologies will be openly documented to ensure reproducibility and trust.
- **Alignment with QNV 2030**: The project shall directly support the pillars of Qatar National Vision 2030, particularly economic diversification, sustainable development, and human capital advancement.
- **Collaborative Innovation**: The model will be developed through partnerships among Education City universities, leveraging diverse expertise in economics, data science, and software engineering.
- **Open Source Commitment**: The codebase will remain publicly accessible under a permissive license, encouraging global scrutiny and continuous improvement.

## C. High-Level Technical Specification

The Qatar National Energy Model is structured around three core components:

1. **Economic Engine**
   - The core simulation logic that applies macroeconomic principles to translate energy production and price scenarios into economic outcomes (GDP growth, sectoral contributions, fiscal balances, etc.).
   - Built on established economic models and calibrated with Qatar-specific parameters.

2. **Data Ingestion Module**
   - A robust system for collecting, validating, and processing historical and projected data on energy production, pricing, exports, and related macroeconomic indicators.
   - Ensures data consistency, supports real-time updates, and provides clean inputs for the Economic Engine.

3. **Results Visualization Dashboard**
   - An intuitive, web-based interface that allows policymakers and researchers to adjust model parameters, run simulations, and visualize outcomes through interactive charts, maps, and reports.
   - Designed for accessibility and ease of use, enabling stakeholders to explore “what‑if” scenarios without requiring programming expertise.
